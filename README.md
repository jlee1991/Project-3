<p>Description of the project (2-3+ sentences).</p>
This is my Developer's Best Friend web application. I had a pretty difficult time working with the code and figuring out Laravel structure, which was both frustrating, but at the same time rewarding. Currently having difficulties getting the code completely working and very much struggling over the functionality of my view pages (lorem ipsum and users).
<p>Any details the instructor or TA needs to know, for example, test credentials.</p>
Apologies, this code is not written to how I had intended in functionality, I've been preparing for interviews all weekend and wasn't able to complete this code in full.
<p>A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project. See Student Responsibilities for more details on avoiding code plagiarism.</p>
I had used some css styling from our foobooks example, but none other then that.
