<h1>Description of the project (2-3+ sentences).</h1>
<p>This is my Developer's Best Friend web application. I had a pretty difficult time working with the code and figuring out Laravel structure, which was both frustrating, but at the same time rewarding. After some troubleshooting on both the local and live versions, I was able to successfully complete the application.</p>
<h1>Any details the instructor or TA needs to know, for example, test credentials.</h1>
<p>I had some comments on my last few projects about using a w3c validator, so I can verify that my HTML link indeed passes through the test online. TAs (you know who you are :) ), thank you for all of the help on this one. I had so much trouble assimilating myself to Laravel!</p>
<h1>A list of any plugins, libraries, packages or outside code used in the project.</h1>
<p>I had used some css styling from our foobooks example, but none other then that.</p>
